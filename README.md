# Google Cloud Run Jobs Emulator

This emulator tries to emulate the behaviour of [Cloud Run Jobs](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/create-jobs). As of this writing, Google does not provide a [Cloud Run Jobs](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/create-jobs) emulator, which makes local development a huge pain. This project aims to help you out until they do release an official emulator.

**This project is not associated with Google.**
